# k-Nearest-Neighbors-Iris-Classification
This is a k-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm used to classify Iris flower species based on their physical features.
k-Nearest-Neighbors.py includes the training algorithm. Running this file will create 20 training and test set splits, make predictions for values of k from 1 to 51 on each of these splits
