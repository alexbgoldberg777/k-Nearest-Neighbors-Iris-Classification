# k-Nearest-Neighbors-Iris-Classification
This is a k-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm used to classify Iris flower species based on their physical features.
k-Nearest-Neighbors.py includes the training algorithm. Running this file will find the optimal k value for 31 random splits of training and testing data. It then plots the accuracies of running the algorithm on each of these splits using that optimal k value. The plot of the most recent run is stored in the Plots folder.

The iris dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
