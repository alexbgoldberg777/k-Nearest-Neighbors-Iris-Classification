# k-Nearest-Neighbors-Iris-Classification
This is a k-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm used to classify Iris flower species based on their physical features.
k-Nearest-Neighbors.py includes the training algorithm. Running this file will create 20 training and test set splits, make predictions for values of k from 1 to 51 on each set of these splits, compute the average accuracy of the model for each value of k, and create plots that showcase these accuracy values.

The iris dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

This project was initially created during Bruno Castro da Silva's Spring 2023 Machine Learning course.
